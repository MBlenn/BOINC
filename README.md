# BOINC

In this repository I am hosting a few scripts that make BOINCing under Linux easier.

#### BOINC instancer
The BOINC instancer allows to create, start/stop and destroy additional BOINC instances on the same host. These can be used for testing or eg. separating different workloads or projects.

#### BOINC lasso
Low effort script to assign BOINC multithreaded WUs to specific cores and L3 complexes, looking to improve performance
